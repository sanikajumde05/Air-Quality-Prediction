# Air-Quality-Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on pollutant levels using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes factors such as PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, SO₂, and other pollutants to forecast AQI values. These predictions can help in issuing health alerts, formulating environmental policies, and optimizing urban planning.

🚀 Features
* Data preprocessing and visualization of air pollutant levels
* Machine learning models for AQI prediction
* Model evaluation and performance metrics
* Insights to assist policymakers and the public
  
🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (ML models)
* Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset
The project uses historical air quality data with pollutant concentrations as input features.
